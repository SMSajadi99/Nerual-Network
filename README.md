## Home Work 04 (Image compression and reconstruction with Neural Network)
In this exercise, we want to try to compress a photo with 3 methods and reconstruct it with a neural network :)

1. [Photo compression by framing the photo and subtracting the average of each frame (using sklearn library)](https://github.com/SMSajadi99/Nerual-Network/blob/main/README.md#photo-compression-by-framing-the-photo-and-subtracting-the-average-of-each-frame-using-sklearn-library)
2. [Photo compression by framing the photo and subtracting the average from the total (using tensorflow library)](https://github.com/SMSajadi99/Nerual-Network/blob/main/README.md#photo-compression-by-framing-the-photo-and-subtracting-the-average-from-the-total-using-tensorflow-library)
3. [Standard PCA method (this method is without neural network)](https://github.com/SMSajadi99/Nerual-Network/blob/main/README.md#standard-pca-method-this-method-is-without-neural-network)
