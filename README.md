## Home Work 04 (Image compression and reconstruction with Neural Network)
In this exercise, we want to try to compress a photo with 3 methods and reconstruct it with a neural network :)

1. [Photo compression by framing the photo and subtracting the average of each frame (using sklearn library)](https://www.google.com)
2. [Photo compression by framing the photo and subtracting the average from the total (using tensorflow library)](https://www.google.com)
3. [Standard PCA method (this method is without neural network)](https://www.google.com)
